        <h1>PFQF Nepal tends to move forward its project under thematic ideology under:</h1>
            <h3>Research and Advocacy:</h3><p style="text-align:left !important;"> Research and advocacy are essential components of social change and
                progress. Research involves the systematic investigation of issues, often through data collection and
                analysis, to gain a deeper understanding of problems and potential solutions. PFQF aims to conduct in-
                depth research and evidence-based advocacy for transparent budgeting and spending processes.
                PFQF will focus on advocacy to promote and support policies and actions, based on research findings.</p>

            <h3>Public Discussion Forum/ Dialogue Forum:</h3><p style="text-align:left !important;">Public discussion and dialogue forums serve as
                platforms for open and constructive conversations on critical societal issues. These forums provide a
                space for people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives to share their views, exchange ideas, and
                seek common ground. They play a crucial role in fostering understanding, promoting collaboration, and
                shaping informed public opinion, ultimately leading to better decision-making and social cohesion. PFQF
                aims to host national/provincial/local public forums where citizens, government officials, and
                experts discuss financial management and accountability.</p>

                <h3>Citizen Engagement/Community Outreach:</h3><p style="text-align:left !important;"> Citizen engagement and community outreach are vital
                    for building strong, inclusive societies. Citizen engagement involves actively involving individuals in the
                    decision-making processes that affect their lives, encouraging their participation in governance, policy
                    development, and community initiatives. Community outreach, on the other hand, entails reaching out to
                    various groups within a community to provide support, information, and resources. PFQF will foster these
                    activities through its field level activities.</p>

                    <h3>Capacity Development:</h3><p style="text-align:left !important;"> PFQF Nepal will focus its activities in capacity development of
                        individuals, organizations, and communities to better fulfill their roles and responsibilities as an informed
                        citizen to raise appropriate question on public funds in appropriate place. It encompasses training, skill-
                        building, and knowledge transfer to enhance their capabilities.</p>
